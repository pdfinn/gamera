# Storage

Gammera stores all persistent data in `$HOME/.gammera`. The directory structure is
simple so it can be inspected or edited with basic tools.

- `history` – list of visited URLs, one per line.
- `bookmarks` – user bookmarks in plain text.

Additional cache files may be added in the future.
